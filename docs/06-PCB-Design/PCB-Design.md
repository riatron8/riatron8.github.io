## Overview

This PCB is designed to control a motor using the Curiosity Nano microcontroller and an H-bridge. It recieves a signal from my teammates from another board, as well as having a debug pushbutton, a debug LED to ensure the system functions, as well as various test points for different signals to verify their functionality.
