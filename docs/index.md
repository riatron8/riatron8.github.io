## Introduction

This datasheet is intended to support the documentation of the Trash Canner project and record what I personally have doen to contribute to this project. It contains my block diagram, component selection, bill of materials, schematic, and power budget.

### Project Summary

The Trash Canner project, linked [here,](https://asu-egr304-2025-f-207.github.io/) is intended to be a design project for an automatic trashcan with a weight and distance sensor. The weight and distance sensor are connected to LEDs, transitioning from green to red as the trashcan gets progressively more full. Ideally this will alert the user to when the trashcan needs to be emptied, and will assist the user in their daily lives. 


### My Contribution
My personal contribution is the motor of the automatic trashcan. After receiving a signal from the motion sensor through my teammate, the motor will automatically open the lid, and after a time, close again (see [block diagram](https://riatron8.github.io/01-Block-Diagram/Block-Diagram/) for a simpler view of the process, and [schematic](https://riatron8.github.io/04-Schematic/schematic/) for a more in-depth view). During this, I had to select various components that my sub-system would use which can be found in the [component selection](https://riatron8.github.io/02-Component-Selection/Component-Selection/) In addtion, I primarily worked on combining the team block diagram, as well creating the team's software proposal. Additionally, I worked on the rest of the assignments, which were more evenly split up between teammates.
