## Overview
This block diagram is intended to convey how this section of the team's project is meant to connect together, as well as the wiring that will take place between the microcontroller and the various components. The connector at the bottom reflects inputs and outputs between the boards of the team members. The arrows indicate the how outputs connect to inputs. In addition, the dotted lines indicate that all components inside are powered by the power source that is highlighted in the corner. The requirements for the project of having an actuator that is connected to a microcontroller and receiving a signal from another subsystem are satisfied with the connection from Hattie's board, and a motor being driven by an h-bridge. The unregulated power supply brings in power for the board to operate, and the voltage regualtor protects the microcontroller, and fulfills the requirement of producing a regulated voltage for power. The test LED and the button fulfill the debugging requirement, and aided in ensuring the subsystem's functionality during testing.
