## Overview

Given the opportunity to redeign the hardware, there are a few major opportunities for improvement. Firstly, the yellow LED is unnecessary for the design, since the microcontroller already has a built in LED that can be triggered without needing more hardware. Additionally, the footprints on the PCB design could be laid out much better, reducing the size of the board and saving on the cost of copper, especially if the design were to go into a larger production. Additionally, designing the system around a more common h-bridge layout would improve the flexibility and ability to test the baord with different h-bridges, as well as aid in replacing a more difficult component to source, instead of requiring a very specific h-bridge in order to fit into the PCB. Additionally, adding even more connections to the board would be prudent for security while testing, but removing the extraneous connections all together would be ideal once the product has been fully tested and it was ready for production.
