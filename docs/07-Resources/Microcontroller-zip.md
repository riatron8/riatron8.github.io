## Overview

This code was used to enable the microcontroller to perform the actions neccesary to properly function as an independant subsystem. It moves a motor for 1 second in one direction, and then moves the motor in the other direction 1 second, using an h-bridge to control the motor.



The code is available to be downloaded as a zip file [*here*](https://github.com/riatron8/riatron8.github.io/raw/main/docs/07-Resources/Individual_Subsystem%20(1).zip)
