Additionally, the H-bridge will easily slot into PCBs, and contains heat sinks to keep the part safe and minimize damage and potential replacement.</p> <p>MOTOR</p> Solution Pros Cons <p> Option 1 Pololu 3483 Metal Gearmotor $35.95/ each Link to product </p> <ul> <li>Able to provide good torque</li> <li>Good RPM</li> <li>Falls within operating necessities</li> </ul> <ul> <li>Heavy</li> <li>Somewhat expensive</li> </ul> Solution Pros Cons <p> Option 2 STANDARD MOTOR 6600 RPM 12V $2.75/ each Link to product </p> <ul> <li>Very cheap</li> <li>High RPM</li> </ul> <ul> <li>Low Strength</li> <li>Ideal Voltage is lower than 12V</li> </ul> Solution Pros Cons <p> Option 3 Portescap 17N78210E.1 Brushed DC Motor $141.02/ each Link to product </p> <ul> <li>High RPM</li> <li>Lightweight</li> <li>Good Torque</li> </ul> <ul> <li>Very expensive</li> <li>Somewhat large</li> </ul> <p>Choice: Option 1: Pololu 4754 Metal Gearmotor Rationale: The Pololu 4754 has the best features for the price. While the Portescap 17N78210E.1 likely outclasses it in terms of features, the significantly higher price is too much. Conversely, although option 2 is much less expensive, it likely will not be able to handle the necessary operations to complete the project.</p> <p>Voltage Regulator</p> Solution Pros Cons <p> Option 1 Taejin LM7805T $0.33/ each Link to product </p> <ul> <li>The team already has these </li> <li>The team already has experience with them</li> <li>Good input voltage range</li> </ul> <ul> <li>Can only be bought in quantities of 100</li> <li>Very high shipping costs</li> </ul> Solution Pros Cons <p> Option 2 L7805CV $0.50/ each Link to product </p> <ul> <li>Very similar to the component we are familiar with</li> <li>Dynamic pricing making it cheaper at high quantities than other options</li> <li>Multiple options to regulate voltage to</li> </ul> <ul> <li>Higher cost for fewer ICs, especially with the amount we would need.</li> </ul> Solution Pros Cons <p> Option 3 TSR 1-2450E $3.40/ each Link to product </p> <ul> <li>High input voltage range</li> <li>Able to regulate down to 3.3 or 5v</li> </ul> <ul> <li>Most expensive</li> <li>Uses an unfamiliar setup</li> </ul> <p>Choice: Option 1: Taejin LM7805T Rationale: This product is the easiest to design the project with, since the team has access and experience with it already. However, in the event of needing to change parts or get replacements, the L7805CV may be a better option. Until those replacements are needed, however, the LM7805T remains the best option.</p> <p>Pushbutton</p> Solution Pros Cons <p> Option 1 TS02-66-43-BK-260-LCR-D $0.10/ each Link to product </p> <ul> <li>The team is already familiar with this product</li> <li>The team already has this product</li> <li>The button is able to be placed flexibly due to its size.</li> <li>Quite cheap</li> </ul> <ul> <li>The button must be positioned well, due to its small dimensions</li> </ul> Solution Pros Cons <p> Option 2 SWITCH TACTILE SPST-NO 0.05A 24V $0.14/ each Link to product </p> <ul> <li>Has a high voltage capacity</li> <li>Similar setup to the button the team is familiar with</li> </ul> <ul> <li>The large profile of the button makes it harder to place</li> </ul> Solution Pros Cons <p> Option 3 CKN12221-1-ND $0.14/ each Link to product </p> <ul> <li>The flush button makes it easier to put on the finished product</li> <li>The price decreases as more are bought, so it is good for bulk purchases</li> </ul> <ul> <li>The button is unlike the one the team is familiar with</li> </ul> <p>Choice: Option 1: TS02-66-43-BK-260-LCR-D Rationale: Since this button is the most familiar, and the size is fairly small, it will likely be the best, saving on the time and money needed to purchase and ship it, while also being small enough to be placed flexibly on the finished product.</p> <p>Primary power supply</p> Solution Pros Cons <p> Option 1 ALITOVE 12V 5A $12.99/ each Link to product </p> <ul> <li>The power supply fits into a wall outlet</li> <li>The DC power jack fits with the other parts the team has used well.</li> <li>The addition of another power head can allow the team to be more flexible after designing</li> </ul> <ul> <li>5A does not quite reach the stall current of the motor</li> <li>It may be more bulky than necessary for our product.</li> </ul> Solution Pros Cons <p> Option 2 1286-1213-ND $7.99/ each Link to product </p> <ul> <li>Good voltage and current rating for the project</li> <li>Multiple suppliers</li> </ul> <ul> <li>Somewhat expensive shipping</li> <li>Does not include wall outlet adapter</li> </ul> Solution Pros Cons <p> Option 3 Generic 12V 3A $4.99/ each Link to product </p> <ul> <li>Cheap and easy to order</li> </ul> <ul> <li>Not enough current for full motor stall</li> <li>Variable quality of generic adapters</li> </ul> <p>Choice: Option 1: ALITOVE 12V 5A  Rationale: The DC power jack connector and the ability to switch the connection type is the most useful, combined with being the cheapest option out of the potential choices. Additionally, the Amperage should be fine, as the motor should never stall in its intended application.</p>"},{"location":"03-BOM/BOM/","title":"Bill of Materials","text":"<p>THE FOLLOWING PAGE IS AN EXAMPLE.
